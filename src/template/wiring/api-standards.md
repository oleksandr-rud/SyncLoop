# SyncLoop Wiring: API Standards

This instruction delegates API and boundary conventions to:

- `.agent-loop/patterns/api-standards.md`

Use that file as authoritative for transport boundaries, schema contracts, and endpoint documentation discipline.

## Resolution Rule

If this file conflicts with `.agent-loop/patterns/api-standards.md`, follow `.agent-loop/patterns/api-standards.md`.

## Registry Source

- `.agent-loop/patterns.md`
