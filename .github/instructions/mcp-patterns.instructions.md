# SyncLoop Wiring: MCP Patterns (M1-M5)

This instruction delegates MCP server patterns to:

- `.agent-loop/patterns/mcp-patterns.md`

Use that file as authoritative for MCP bootstrap, resources, tools, prompts, and capability negotiation.

## Resolution Rule

If this file conflicts with `.agent-loop/patterns/mcp-patterns.md`, follow `.agent-loop/patterns/mcp-patterns.md`.

## Registry Source

- `.agent-loop/patterns.md`
