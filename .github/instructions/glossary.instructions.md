# SyncLoop Wiring: Glossary

This instruction delegates canonical terminology to:

- `.agent-loop/glossary.md`

Use terms, naming rules, and deprecated aliases from that file for code, docs, and reasoning.

## Resolution Rule

If this file conflicts with `.agent-loop/glossary.md`, follow `.agent-loop/glossary.md`.
