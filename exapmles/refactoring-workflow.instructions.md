# SyncLoop Wiring: Refactoring Workflow

This instruction delegates refactor process rules to:

- `.agent-loop/patterns/refactoring-workflow.md`

Use that file as authoritative for 4-phase refactoring, dependency impact checks, and safe migration flow.

## Resolution Rule

If this file conflicts with `.agent-loop/patterns/refactoring-workflow.md`, follow `.agent-loop/patterns/refactoring-workflow.md`.

## Registry Source

- `.agent-loop/patterns.md`
