# SyncLoop Wiring: Testing Guide

This instruction delegates testing patterns and strategy to:

- `.agent-loop/patterns/testing-guide.md`

Use that file as authoritative for test pyramid placement, fixtures, mocking, and verification sequencing.

## Resolution Rule

If this file conflicts with `.agent-loop/patterns/testing-guide.md`, follow `.agent-loop/patterns/testing-guide.md`.

## Registry Source

- `.agent-loop/patterns.md`
